A fake file system for [Deno](https://deno.land) binaries by [Mandarine](https://deno.land/x/mandarinets).

------------

## Description
Leaf is a fake file system for Deno binaries. This means, you can save your files along with the binary generated by `deno compile`, this way, you can put all your files together in a single executable which leads to easier deployments and a more compacted deliverable output.

## Usage
Using **Leaf** in your application is very simple, you just use the regular Deno APIs after you do `leaf compile`.

### compile
The `compile` method is responsible for creating a binary with your resources in it. `compile` takes one argument which is the options to include.
```typescript
import { Leaf } from "https://deno.land/x/leaf/mod.ts";

Leaf.compile({
    modulePath: "./myEntryPoint.ts",
    contentFolders: ["./resources"]
})
```
`modulePath` and `contentFolders` are necessary.  

- `modulePath`: File to be compiled into a binary.
- `contentFolders`: Folders to be attached to the binary.

### readFileSync
Synchronously reads and returns the entire contents of a file as an array of bytes. `TextDecoder` can be used to transform the bytes to string if required. Reading a directory returns an empty data array.

```typescript
const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
const data = Deno.readFileSync("hello.txt");
console.log(decoder.decode(data));
```

### readFile
Reads and returns the entire contents of a file as an array of bytes. `TextDecoder` can be used to transform the bytes to string if required. Reading a directory returns an empty data array.

```typescript
const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
const data = await Deno.readFile("hello.txt");
console.log(decoder.decode(data));
```

### readTextFileSync
Synchronously reads and returns the entire contents of a file as utf8 encoded string.
```typescript
const data = Deno.readTextFileSync("hello.txt");
console.log(data);
```

### readTextFile
Reads and returns the entire contents of a file as utf8 encoded string.
```typescript
const data = await Deno.readTextFile("hello.txt");
console.log(data);
```

## Example

_file1.ts:_

```typescript
import { Leaf } from "https://deno.land/x/leaf/mod.ts";

Leaf.compile({
    modulePath: "./myEntryPoint.ts",
    contentFolders: ["./resources"]
})
```

_./resources/hello.txt_
```text
Hello World
```

_myEntryPoint.ts:_
```typescript

console.log(Leaf.readTextFileSync("./resources/hello.txt"));
```

```batch
deno run --allow-all --unstable myEntryPoint.ts
```
```batch
./myEntryPoint (.exe if windows)
# output: Hello World
```
